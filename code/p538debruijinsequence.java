/*
 * Given a set of characters C and an integer k, a De Bruijin sequence is a cyclic sequence in which every possible k-length string of characters in C occurs exactly once.
 *  
 * For example, suppose C = {0, 1} and k = 3. Then our sequence should contain the substrings: 000, 001, 010, 100, 101, 110, 111 and one possible solution would be 00010111. (100 and 110 are accounted for because they wrap around from one end to the other.)
