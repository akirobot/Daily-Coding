/*
 * You are given a 2 x N board and have to completely cover it with the following shapes:
 *  - Dominoes, or 2 x 1 rectangles
 *  - Trominoe, or L-shapes.
 * 
 * For example, if N = 4, here is one possible configuration, where A is a domino, and B and C are trominoes.
 * 
 * A B B C
 * A B C C
 * 
 * The other solutions, letters are dominoes, numbers are trominoes:
 * A B C D | A A B B
 * A B C D | C C D D
 * 
 * 1 1 2 A | A 1 1 2 | 1 2 2 A | A 1 2 2
 * 1 2 2 A | A 1 2 2 | 1 1 2 A | A 1 1 2
 * 
 * 1 1 2 2 | 1 A A 2
 * 1 A A 2 | 1 1 2 2
 * 
 * This is more of a math problem than a coding problem.
