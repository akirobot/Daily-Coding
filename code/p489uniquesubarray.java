/*
 * Given an array of elements, return the length of the longest subarray where all its elements are distinct.
 * 
 * For example, given the array [5, 1, 3, 5, 2, 3, 4, 1] Return 5 as the longest subarray of distinct elements is [5, 2, 3, 4, 1] (I think this example is wrong, it should be [5, 1, 3, 2, 4], I don't know why it was written that way.)
 * 
 * I think there's a couple of ways to approach this.
 *  You could iterate over the entire array, only extracating the elements that have not appeared yet into a separate array.
 *  You could run a total on the number of element appearances in the given array and the final result is the length of the array of totals.
 *  You could convert the array into a list an extract each element that has already appeared before.
