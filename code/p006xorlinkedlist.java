/*
 * An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list. Instead of each node holding next and prev fields, it hots a field named both, which is an XOR of the next node and the previous node. Implement an XOR linked list, which has an add(element) which adds an element to the end, and a get(index) which returns the node at index. If using a language that has no pointers (such as Python), you can assume you have access to get_pointer and dereference_pointer functions that converts between nodes and memory addresses.
