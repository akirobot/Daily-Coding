public class p387APIvsSDK {
    /*
        APIs (Application Program Interface) and SDKs (Software Development Kit) are both commonly used in programming as sometimes you need access to information, and the easiest way to get it most of the time is to ask the owner for access to an API or SDK depending on the situation. APIs are generally for websites, SDKs are for programs.

        APIs essentially give you access to a database that you can request information from. You are generally given some sort of access code to be able to do this. None of the code is given to you, only the information that is available and you request (unless the API was somehow created to do that). This also allows programs to share information easier between each other, while not requiring both to constantly share information between them, instead only requesting the information that is required when it is needed.

        SDKs give you a section of the source code that can help you with your own development. Essentially, this gives the developer a look under the hood of how a piece of software works so they can better develop a program of their own that interacts with it. One of the more common uses of SDKs is in game development, where the developer will make a portion of the source code available to the public so they can use it to create mods. It would still be possible to mod most games without it, but having the SDK available makes modding significantly easier for both the creators and the users.
