    //Web cookies are a way for websites to store information.
    //One of the most common kind of web cookie is used to store login information, so you don't need to log in every time you visit a website (unless the website uses a shorter timer for their cookies). In some cases, cookies are only available for that session, while the browser is still running, or sometimes, only while the page is open. Most cookies have an expiration date where they become no longer valid and need to be refreshed by visiting the site that created them again. In some cases this means re-logging in to a website or simply revisiting it in the browser.
    //A second kind of web cookie is used for authentication, where the cookie is generated when the site is first visited, and this allows the website to recognize who is accessing it.
    //The most controversial kind is the tracker cookie, where your information, generally your browsing history, is given over to a site for generally malaise purposes like targeted advertising, but could potentially reveal more information about you than you would share normally. More recently, websites are required to ask you for permission to use any non-essential cookie to help alleviate some of the fears and/or risks that people feel about this type of cookie.
